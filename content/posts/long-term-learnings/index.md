_[til.nabarun.dev](https://til.nabarun.dev)_ started as a running log of what I learned daily. I _thought_ I could post freely on new learning every day.

But that didn't happen. The CMS tool backing this page was still a high-friction activity for me. I have been writing learnings on Notion because it is a low-friction activity.

**Lesson learnt: Stick to low-friction activities.**
